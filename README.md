# [Awesome *SSHConfig*](https://github.com/sshconfigio/awesome_sshconfig)
A curated list of awesome hacks for [SSHConfig](http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man5/ssh_config.5?query=ssh_config); for several years I've improved the use of my ssh_config file, and here I share everything I have obtained so far; I use this on Mac OS X, but it should be straightforward to adapt this to Linux.

So far, here is what I have obtained:
- [Separated SSH config files](#separated-ssh-config-files)
- [A sane _default_ config file](#a-sane-default-config-file)
- [ControMaster / ControlPath](#contromaster--controlpath)
- [PKI Authentication](#pki-authentication)
- [Tunnels](#tunnels)
- [Jump Hosts](#jump-hosts)
- [SOCKS Proxy](#socks-proxy)
- [Remote copy](#remote-copy)
- [Forward Agent](#forward-agent)
- [Keep Alive](#keep-alive)
- [Default user defined by context](#default_user)

## Separated SSH config files
OpenSSH does not have an option to read several config files, or including everything inside a given directory; it only reads options, either from the command line, from _/etc/ssh/ssh_config_ or _~/.ssh/config_.

This is fine, if you have a couple of hosts on your _SSHConfig_ file, but if that grows, and you are like me, and have hundreds of hosts, there is a need to separate config files, to differentiate for example, **Production** from **Development**.

To obtain this, first create a folder inside your ~/.ssh, lets call it _configs_; after this, throw your config files inside, using the _.config_ extension, and also add a file with the name _default_.

Now here is the fun part! Add the next aliases to your _.bashrc_ (or _.zshrc_, if you are with the cool kids):

```
alias sshconfig="vim ~/.ssh/configs"

alias sshcompile="echo -n >! ~/.ssh/config && cat
~/.ssh/configs/*.config >> ~/.ssh/config && cat ~/.ssh/configs/default
>> ~/.ssh/config"

alias ssh="sshcompile && ssh"
```

The last line is optional, you can comment it out if you want to "compile" _SSHConfig_ manually; Leave it like this, if you want to "compile" SSHConfig each time you connect to a host (recommended). _sshcompile_ cleans the ~/.ssh/config, concatenates all the _.config_ files inside the directory, and lastly, concatenates the _default_ file to the end of the config; this way, you get your _SSHConfig_ file all organized.

## A sane *default* config file
A good place to start with your **SSHConfig** is to setup a global default file, which will be added at the end of the final config file. I usually set all the same defaults there, and also give some examples in the form of comments, for future generations :). I have provided a good base in the _configs_ directory, so you can start using it right away.

```

I will explain what most of this stuff does in the next sections, for now, just notice the **Host *** declaration; this affects all hosts, and it's overwritten if you declare it inside a given host or on the command line. For example, imagine if you are connecting to a server and the user is not _myuser_... you either can specify that on the command line using:

```
ssh anotheruser@remotehost
```

or you can declare it in a host entry on the _SSHConfig_ file:

```
Host remotehost
  HostName remotehost.example.com
  User anotherUser
```

The default is just that, something to fall back if you don't specify it.

## ControMaster / ControlPath
During a normal work day, you might connect to a lot of systems, and use public/private key authentication; This is fine, but most of the times, even though we have tools like _screen_ that allow us to have multiple terminals on the remote server, it's way faster to just open a new connection to the server. Each time you connect to a remote server, you end up creating a new connection and socket, and depending on the size and security of your keys, or if you are using password authentication (shame on you), it gets a little annoying to wait those seconds for the connection, or having to type, over and over again a password. Also, as we explain further down this document, when using Jump Hosts, if you do not have _ControlMaster_ on, you will have to authenticate each time on the _server-in-the-middle_ for your remote server; I can not emphasize more how boring this is. _SSHConfig_ manual pages tell us this:

```
ControlMaster

             Enables the sharing of multiple sessions over a single
network connection.  When set to ``yes'', ssh(1) will listen for
connections on a control socket specified using the ControlPath
argument.  Additional sessions can connect to
             this socket using the same ControlPath with ControlMaster
set to ``no'' (the default).  These sessions will try to reuse the
master instance's network connection rather than initiating new ones,
but will fall back to connecting
             normally if the control socket does not exist, or is not
listening.
```

I recommend creating a _tmp_ directory inside _~/.ssh/_ and store everything related to _ControlMaster/ControlPath_ inside, like is noted on the _default_ config file.

```
  ControlMaster auto
  ControlPath ~/.ssh/tmp/%r@%h:%p
```

From now on, each time you reconnect to a host, that you are already connected to, _ControlMaster_ will share the same connection, no matter how many times you use this (which can be a lot, when you are using [JumpHosts](#jump-hosts)).

## PKI Authentication
Authentication without passwords, using strong public/private keys.

## Tunnels
Exposing remote and local ports.

## Jump Hosts
Imagine this scenario: I use a IPSec VPN connection to my work, and the security guys are not very fond of SSH. However I ended up convincing them to allow me, at least, to connect to one host, which has access to all the other hosts in the network, or, at least some of them; I have disallowed passwords, and I'm using a combination of PKI with One Time Password (using [Google Auth](https://github.com/google/google-authenticator)).

I could access my servers the usual (newbie) way, in where I access the **JUMPHOST** and then I access the required server, example:

```
ssh jumphost
    [myuser@JUMPHOST01 ~]$
ssh insidehost
    [myuser@INSIDEHOST01~]$
```

This is fun and all, and it works, but it gets boring quick! At least we are already using ControlMaster, so we only authenticate the first time (remember, here I am using PKI+OTP).

But there is a better, cleaner solution! First, let's create an entry, for the **INSIDEHOST01** and for a second host, let's call it **INSIDEHOST02**:

```
Host insidehost1 j.insidehost1
  HostName insidehost01.example.com

Host insidehost2 j.insidehost2
  HostName insidehost02.example.com
```

I could setup four different entries for these two hosts, one for the normal connection, another for using the jump host, but I use a trick, where I can specify multiple alias in the **Host** parameter; this way, I can create a default entry for the **j.hosts** entry, like we did on the **Host ***. Just add this inside _default_ config file, or create a _JUMP.config_ inside the _configs_ directory:

```
  Host jumphost
    HostName jumphost01.example.com

  Host j.*
  ProxyCommand ssh jumphost nc -w 120 %h %p
```

You can create several different jump hosts, depending on context, and you can also jump more than one server, for example, if you need to get to _insidehost1_ to reach _insidehost2_, just declare:

```
Host insidehost2
  HostName insidehost02.example.com
  ProxyCommand ssh j.insidehost1 nc -w 120 %h %p
```

This way, you first SSH to JUMPHOST01, then to INSIDEHOST01, and finally to INSIDEHOST02, everything automatically. If you are using public key authentication, and you already are connected to the first jumphost, you will login directly on the final destination.

Note that any option you give to a jumphost, will be set on the final destination, for example, a port forwarding; it will no be forwarded inside the first jumphost.

## SOCKS Proxy
Using my last scenario, where I need to connect to my work using an IPSec VPN, a need to access internal websites arrises a lot; also, sometimes I need to test some service running on a given port, and back in the days I did the naive approach to make a LocalForward, which works well for one or two ports, but as usual, if this grows, it gets out of control quickly.
So, what does OpenSSH offer that can help us with this? __DynamicForward__ for the rescue!

Still on my last scenario, the __JUMPHOST01__ host could reach everything inside my network, and DNS also works from that server, so I just have to tweak the __Host__ entry:
```
Host jumphost
  HostName jumphost01.example.com
  DynamicForward :7777
```
Now just configure your system to point to a [_SOCKS5_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOCKS) proxy, on _localhost:7777_ and you are good to go! I usually use [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/products/), because it allows me to configure proxy settings separated from the system.
By now, any request you make to the browser, will effectively go through that host, even if it is a site with a different port, other then _HTTP_(80) or _HTTPS_(443).

Yep, this is amazing, I know! :)

## Remote copy
One thing I use a lot on the command line (on MacOS X) is [pbcopy](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/pbcopy.1.html). If I need to copy the contents of some file, let's say it, a log file, I can do:

```
cat example.log | pbcopy
```

and the contents of _example.log_ will be on my clipboard, ready to be pasted somewhere, like in a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/).

This works great, but only on _localhost_, and most of the time I am working on remote servers, so it would be great to have **pbcopy** at my hands on those servers; I usually just select with the mouse some text, but if the text is very big, I have to copy the file to localhost, and use **pbcopy**, or if my user has permissions to access that file, I end up doing:

```
ssh somehost cat /var/log/example.log | pbcopy
```

It works, but, wouldn't be great to be able to pull pbcopy, straight where I'm working?

My first approach to this solution was to do a **RemoteForward** of my localhost SSH server port (22), to remote port 55555, and create and alias on the remote server (_.bashrc_):

```
alias pbcopy='ssh -p55555 localuser@localhost pbcopy'
```

This works, because I SSH into my localhost, and run pbcopy, but there is a better way to do it, has I found out later; other users needed this, and implementend a better way, using the [netcat](http://nc110.sourceforge.net/) (nc). First, you _daemonize_ a local listener, for example, inside a [_Screen_](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/)

```
while (true); do nc -l 55555 | pbcopy; done
```

You still need to RemoteForward something to the remote host, so I just put that on the _default_ file (we did that already):

```
RemoteForward 55555 127.0.0.1:55555
```

Now, we need to define on our remote hosts, a different alias:

```
alias pbcopy='nc localhost 55555'
```

And thats it! Next time, you are on remote server you can use _pbcopy_ as you would normally use it on _localhost_.

### A better way to _daemonize_ pbcopy
By now you should get the concept of _daemonizing_ pbcopy; if you are using Linux, I will add a better way to do this later. If you are like me, and are using MacOS X, there is a better way to achieve a pbcopy _daemon_ and it's using the built in [launchd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launchd).

Simply add the [provided](https://github.com/sshconfigio/awesome_sshconfig/blob/master/misc/pbcopy.plist) _launchd_ script to _~/Library/LaunchAgents/pbcopy.plist_ and run:

```
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/pbcopy.plist
```

Now you have the pbcopy listener running, no need to use a _screen_ session.

### netcat VS SSH
Please notice: by using the netcat method, any user on the same server as you could connect to port 55555 and inject stuff on your local pasteboard; if you can live well with this possibility, use netcat, if not, use my first approach, exploiting SSH _RemoteForward._

## Forward Agent
Holding your keys to reuse

## Keep Alive
... so your connection is not dropped!

## Default user defined by context
